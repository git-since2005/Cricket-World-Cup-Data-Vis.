## Project Overview
This project is an End-To-End ML web application that predicts the winning IPL team based on the 1st inning played by another team and shows some statistics of  the team's performance in IPL.<br/>

It implements a variety of machine learning algorithms in order to predict the
result of a match between two teams in a given IPL season, with the game state provided
as input. One can configure details like the target score, current score, overs completed,
wickets lost etc and these parameters are used by the model ( Logistic Regression,
Random Forest or Decision Tree set by the user) to decide a winner by
probability.
Another feature is the generation of certain stats specific to teams or seasons,
presented in the form of histograms,bar charts etc. The data presented can be
used to gain valuable insights and get a better understanding of the trends seen
in the biggest cricket league in the world.
The dataset for the project will be obtained from Kaggle, which has information
from 2008 to the present year.
The website will be hosted on the cloud, leveraging some of the benefits
associated with cloud hosting such as zero down time.
As the popularity of data analysis in sport has grown hugely in recent years, this
seems to be a suitable topic to learn and improve oneâ€™s ability to work with data,
while having fun along the way.
